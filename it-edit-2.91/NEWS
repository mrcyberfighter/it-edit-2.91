NEW in it-edit (2.91)
*********************

  Except some minor bugfix and the new file loading system using the the GtkSourceFileLoader for loading files.
 
  Their is nothing new into it-edit-2.91 but the underlying library:
 
  * libvte has upgraded so I have upgraded it-edit !
 
  so that it-edit use livbte-2.91 instead of libvte-2_90, what a great advancement.
